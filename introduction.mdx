### Getting Started

<Accordion title="Step 1: Create an API Key">
  To start using the Murf API, you’ll need an API key to authenticate your requests. Follow these steps:

  * <a href="https://murf.ai/api/signup">Create an account</a> if you don’t already have one.

  * <a href="https://murf.ai/api/dashboard">Log in</a> to your Murf dashboard.

  * Navigate to the <a href="https://murf.ai/api/docs">API documentation page</a> and click the "Create API Key" button to generate your key.
    Use this API key in the `Authorization` header for all API requests. For more details, check out the <a href="https://murf.ai/api/reference#authentication">authentication docs</a>.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Step 2: Retrieve Voice Options">
  To use the Murf API for text-to-speech, you need the `voiceId` for the desired voice. Follow these steps:
  - Visit the <a href="https://murf.ai/voices">Voices and Styles</a> section on the Murf website to explore available voices and styles.
  - Use the <a href="https://murf.ai/api/dashboard">text-to-speech component</a> in the API dashboard to preview voices and test settings like pitch, speed, and language.
  - Alternatively, make a GET request to the `/v1/speech/voices` endpoint to programmatically retrieve all available voices. This provides `voiceId`, name, and styles.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Step 3: Generate Speech">
  Once you have the `voiceId`, you can generate speech by sending a POST request to the `/v1/speech/generate` endpoint. Include your API key in the `Authorization` header and specify parameters like text, style, pitch, and rate.

  Example request in Python:

  ```python
  import requests
  import json

  url = "https://api.murf.ai/v1/speech/generate"
  payload = {
      "voiceId": "en-US-natalie",
      "text": "Welcome to the AI E-Learning Course!",
      "style": "Promo",
      "rate": 0,
      "pitch": 0,
      "sampleRate": 48000,
      "format": "MP3"
  }
  headers = {
      "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
      "Content-Type": "application/json"
  }
  response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)
  print(response.json())
For detailed examples, see the API Reference.
