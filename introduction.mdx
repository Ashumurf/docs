#### Troubleshooting

In this section, we will tackle common problems that you might experience while integrating Murf's API into your systems.

###### Token Expiration

The auth tokens generated by [Create Auth Token operation](https://murf.ai/api/reference)  will expire 30 minutes from creation. Make sure to regenerate a new token using that same endpoint to prevent disruption of service.

###### CORS Error

Even if you've obtained an API key, there can be instances where your requests are being blocked due to CORS. For development and testing, localhost:3000 is whitelisted by default, requests can be sent from there. For production environments, make sure the origin domain is approved as a request origin by Murf. You can provide a set of domains and they will be approved for use by Murf.

Caution

While it is possible to build workflows that access Murf API from the browser, we recommend the usage of server-side languages to integrate Murf API into your business logic.

#### FAQ

###### Can I try API before purchasing?

Murf AI provides a generous free trial plan, allowing users to experience the API capabilities. This plan includes 10,000 characters, enabling users to test the functionality and performance of the API without any cost. No credit card required. No days limit on the trial.

###### What is the pricing for API?

Murf API offers a Pay-as-you-go model which is ideal for users with varying needs. Users top-up their wallet and will be charged based on the number of characters sent to the service to be synthesised into audio. Check out the Murf API [pricing page](https://murf.ai/api/account?qState=upgrade) for more details. You can also  [contact us](https://murf.ai/enterprise)  for large scale requirements or a tailored plan.

###### Do I own the audio output files?

Yes, the person who created them owns the output. You are still required to inform end users that they are hearing an audio generated by AI and not a real person talking to them.
